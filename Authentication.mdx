# Razorpay Authentication

## Overview
Razorpay is India's leading all-in-one financial solutions platform for businesses, offering a comprehensive suite to accept, process, and disburse online payments through various methods (cards, UPI, wallets, net banking) via a powerful payment gateway.


Razorpay APIs are authenticated using an API Key (Key ID and Key Secret) via HTTP Basic authentication.

- **Client ID** = Razorpay **Key ID** 
- **Client Secret** = Razorpay **Key Secret**

Your credentials are stored as encrypted secrets in Boltic and are used to build the `Authorization` header for each request.

## Authentication Method
- API Key (Key ID & Key Secret) using HTTP Basic auth

The integration sends:
- `Authorization: Basic base64(<key_id>:<key_secret>)`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

## How to Get Test Client ID and Client Secret
1. Sign in to the Razorpay Dashboard: <a href="https://dashboard.razorpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dashboard.razorpay.com</a>
2. Select **Payments** tab.
3. Switch to **Test Mode** (left panel toggle button).
4. Go to **Account & Settings**.
5. Click **API keys** under Website and app settings.
6. Click **Generate Key** (or use an existing test key).
7. Copy and store:
   - **Key ID** → use as **Client ID** in Boltic.
   - **Key Secret** → use as **Consumer Secret** in Boltic.

## Notes
- Keep the **Key Secret** private and treat it like a password.
- Test keys only work in Test Mode; Live keys only work in Live Mode.
- If authentication fails, verify you copied the correct Key ID/Secret pair and that the integration is configured with the right environment.
