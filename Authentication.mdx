# Razorpay Authentication

## Overview
Razorpay is an all-in-one financial platform for businesses to accept, process, and disburse payments online, offering features like payment gateways for cards/UPI/wallets.
Razorpay APIs are authenticated using an API Key (Key ID and Key Secret) to ensure secure and authorized communication.

## Authentication Ways

- API Key (Key ID & Key Secret)

## API Key (Key ID & Key Secret)

To authenticate with Razorpay, generate an API Key from your Razorpay Dashboard and configure the **Key ID** and **Key Secret** in Boltic.

In this integration:
- **Client ID** = Razorpay **Key ID** (typically starts with `rzp_test_...` in Test Mode)
- **Client Secret** = Razorpay **Key Secret**

**Steps:**

1. **Sign in to Razorpay Dashboard**  
   - Go to <a href="https://dashboard.razorpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>dashboard.razorpay.com</span></a> and log in.

2. **Switch to Test Mode**  
   - Toggle **Test Mode** from the dashboard (top/left toggle, depending on your dashboard layout).

3. **Open API Keys**  
   - Go to **Account & Settings → API Keys**.

4. **Generate Key**  
   - Click **Generate Key** (or use an existing test key).

5. **Configure in Boltic**  
   - **Key ID** → set as **Client ID**  
   - **Key Secret** → set as **Client Secret**
